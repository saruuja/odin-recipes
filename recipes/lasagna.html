        <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or 
        dough that is cooked between two plates that are 
        patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and 
        surface impression. There are many variations based on the 
        type of waffle iron and recipe used. </p>

<h1>Hatch Chile Salsa</h1>
<img src="Chile.jpeg" alt="Chile Salsa"/>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>According to Cotanch, Hatch chiles' popularity stems 
from their flavor more than their spiciness. ... Hatch chiles range 
in heat level from mild–for those seeking just the smoky flavor–to extra hot, 
which rivals the New Mexico sun on the Scoville scale (we assume).</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
 <li>5 Hatch chile peppers, stems removed</li>
 <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
 <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with roasted garlic</li>
 <li>½ onion, roughly chopped</li>
 <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
 <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<lo>
    <li>Step 1</li>
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; add Hatch chile peppers.
<li>Step 2</li>
Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.
<li>Step 3</li>
Blend roasted Hatch chile peppers, diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, onion, cilantro, and garlic powder in a food processor or blender until desired consistency is reached.
